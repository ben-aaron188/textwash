Kate Middleton is the wife of Prince William. She is a mother of 3 children; 2 boys and a girl. Kate is educated to university level and that is where she met her future husband. Kate dresses elegantly and is often seen carrying out charity work. However, she is a mum first and foremost and the interactions we see with her children are adorable. Kate’s sister, Pippa, has followed Kate into the public eye. She was born in 1982 and will soon turn 40. When pregnant, Kate suffers from a debilitating illness called Hyperemesis Gravidarum, which was little known about until it was reported that Kate had it.
